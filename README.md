# Binary-to-Gray-Code-converter
A Gray Code is an encoding of numbers so that adjacent numbers have a single digit differing by 1. Gray Code is  advantageous  because  of minimized switching circuits required to implement it.
* Binary digit is converted to gray code by xoring the adjacent bits. I have made 4 bit binary to gray code converter using verilog.

## Toolchain
* Xilinx ISE for synthesis
* Isim for simulation
